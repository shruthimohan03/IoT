Time Series on a Sensor Dataset
Dataset used: Room Occupancy dataset from kaggle
-The time series shows the variation in temperature with respect to the room occupancy and this data is captured by sensors on minute bases.
-Using ARIMA, we get a clear pattern on the prediction for the next two days on whether there will be occupancy ( based on temperature ) and during what time of the day.
